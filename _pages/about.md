I am a Medical studies PhD candidate at the university of Plymouth, working on large genomics data. I take a data-driven approach to investigating the genomics that underlie neurodegenerative diseases, to really make the most out of all the information that we have access to. I received my MSc from the biomedical sciences program at Plymouth University and my BSc in Biomedicine from the University of East Anglia. I'm passionate about integrating biology and data science.

I have experience in using both R and python to apply machine learning models to genomics datasets of complex diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. In addition to machine learning, I have applied other statistical techniques, including meta-analysis, to genomics data as well as developed novel R functions to apply to gene network analysis to identify hub genes.

From my first author publications on work using genomics data I have experience in effective academic writing and the publishing process, as well as experience reviewing papers for multiple journals including the Journal of Translational Medicine. I have presented posters on my work at national Alzheimer's and Parkinson's conferences and international conferences including the FENS neuroscience conference, and given presentations on my work at large workshops.

I have taken training courses in big data methods in R and the machine learning courses offered by Plymouth university while studying for my PhD, demonstrating my dedication to improving my skill sets so I can perform the best work possible. I am highly motivated to apply my knowledge of data analysis and deep learning to imaging data. I am excited to collaborate with others with differing expertise and knowledge to my own to produce the best work possible.
