I am a Medical studies PhD candidate at the university of Plymouth, working on large genomics data. I take a data-driven approach to investigating the genomics that underlie neurodegenerative diseases, to really make the most out of all the information that we have access to. 

I received my MSc from the biomedical sciences program at Plymouth University and my BSc in Biomedicine from the University of East Anglia. I'm passionate about integrating biology and data science.
