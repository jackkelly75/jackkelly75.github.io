    title: "Genetic networks in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease"
    text: "In this project, I  conducted a network analysis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease based on their gene expressions in blood. Modules, important hub genes and transcription factors that were not preserved between disease and healthy networks were identified. This work demonstrated that PD and AD share common disrupted genetics and identified novel pathways, hub genes and TFs that may be new areas for mechanistic study and important targets in both diseases.

#    title: "Marketing Analytics"
#    text: "In a series of Marketing Analytics projects, I used Online Retail II dataset to create cohorts based on monthly data, calculated retention rates and visualized them via a heatmap. Then I created RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segments, calculated RFM Score for each customer and segmented into 3 custom segments 'Top', 'Middle' and 'Low' based on the total RFM Score. Finally, I calculated the revenue-based CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) for each customer."

#    title: "Purchase Analytics"
#    text: "In this project, I analyzed purchase behavior of customers that bought 5 different brands of chocolate bars in a physical FMCG store during 2 years. In total, they made 58,693 transactions, captured through the loyalty cards they used at checkout. Based on the results of customer segmentation, I explored the segments sizes and answered the following business questions: 1. How often do people from different segments visit the store? 2. What brand do customer segments prefer on average? 3. How much revenue each customer segment brings?"

To do this, I extracted relevant data from a real estate MySQL database, analyzed data in Excel to identify the best opportunities to increase revenue and maximize profits and created a Tableau dashboard to show the results of a sensitivity analysis."

The datasets provided by Figure Eight contain real messages sent during disaster events and their respective categories. The task was to train the supervised ML classifier to automate categorization of the new messages so that different disaster relief agencies would receive only relevant ones. The model was then deployed as a Python Flask app to Heroku."

I worked with real-life data provided by Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, I assessed and cleaned the data in order to convert the data into a usable form."

#     title: "Image Classifier"
#     text: "In this project, I have first developed code for an image classifier built with PyTorch in Jupyter Notebook, then converted it into a command line application. The application allows you to choose one of the pretrained architectures, specify different hyperparameters (learning rate, hidden layers, epochs) and use either GPU or CPU for training. I also implemented saving the checkpoints so that you can continue training if stopped. Image Classifier predicts 102 flower categories. "
