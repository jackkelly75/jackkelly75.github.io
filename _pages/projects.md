    title: "Genetic networks in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease"
    text: "In this project, I  conducted a network analysis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease based on their gene expressions in blood. Modules, important hub genes and transcription factors that were not preserved between disease and healthy networks were identified. This work demonstrated that PD and AD share common disrupted genetics and identified novel pathways, hub genes and TFs that may be new areas for mechanistic study and important targets in both diseases.

    alt: "Methodology of meta-analysis"
    title: "Gene expression meta-analysis of Parkinson’s disease and its relationship with Alzheimer’s disease"
    text: "Using a novel meta-analysis methodology I identified DEGs in PD brain transcriptomics data. 1046 DEGs were identified of which a majority (>70%) were downregulated. The perturbed pathways include mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, and YWHAZ and other genes coding 14–3-3 proteins are highlighted. AD and PD show a significant overlap in DEGs, of which >99% were differentially expressed in the same direction and identifies novel genes, pathways and upstream regulators which may be important targets for therapy in both diseases."

    title: "Discovery methods for systematic analysis of causal molecular networks in modern _omics_ datasets"
    text: "With the increasing availability and size of multi-omics datasets, investigating the casual relationships between molecular phenotypes has become an important aspect of exploring underlying biology and genetics. This paper aims to introduce and review the available methods for building large-scale causal molecular networks that have been developed in the past decade. Existing methods have their own strengths and limitations so there is no one best approach, and it is instead down to the discretion of the researcher. This review also aims to discuss some of the current limitations to biological interpretation of these networks, and important factors to consider for future studies on molecular networks."

To do this, I extracted relevant data from a real estate MySQL database, analyzed data in Excel to identify the best opportunities to increase revenue and maximize profits and created a Tableau dashboard to show the results of a sensitivity analysis."

#     text: "In this project, I built a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. The datasets provided by Figure Eight contain real messages sent during disaster events and their respective categories. The task was to train the supervised ML classifier to automate categorization of the new messages so that different disaster relief agencies would receive only relevant ones. The model was then deployed as a Python Flask app to Heroku."

The application allows you to choose one of the pretrained architectures, specify different hyperparameters (learning rate, hidden layers, epochs) and use either GPU or CPU for training. I also implemented saving the checkpoints so that you can continue training if stopped. Image Classifier predicts 102 flower categories. "
